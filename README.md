logoish
=======

A logo inspired language that can do also do very basic animation.

Simple syntax .. 
 * No optional arguments for any functions.
   * As a side effect, we need neither special characters, nor any indentation to seperate.
 * no special characters *needed* what so ever . 
 * use ctrl+enter or press "run" to run the program.

Use help to get a list of commands and functions you can use "help".

Use the "listexamples" command to get a list of available examples.
Then use showexample with the name of the example you want to use.

**Big fat Warning**: Alpha/pre-alpha/bleeding-edge/Toy quality stuff. Not for serious or production use.
 * Syntax subject to change.
 * No syntax check .. currently, if you dont adhere to the syntax in a looping program (repeated commands or animation), it could generally lockup your machine for a few seconds or minutes. In exceptional cases, there is a chance of infinite loop.

Happy drawing! And don't forget to "pendown".
